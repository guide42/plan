TODO
====

- [ ] `asset\one` like `assert\any` but strict only one; or add a `$count`
  parameter to `assert\any` to count the exact times that a validator was
  success.

- [ ] `assert\set` as an unordered collection of unique elements.

- [ ] `assert\includes` or `assert\contains` that could work for strings and
  arrays alike.
