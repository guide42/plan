#### Licensing

The plan codebase is under ISC license. All code submitted must be licensed
under these terms (2-clause BSD, MIT, etc.).

#### Making Changes

1. Fork guide42/plan on Github.
2. Create a topic branch: `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`.
3. Wrap code at 80 characters with 4-space soft tabs. Coding standards are
   pretty much the same as everywhere with some little differences; you will
   notice when reading the code.
4. Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
5. If applicable, add tests for your changes.
6. Run _all_ tests to ensure nothing has been broken by your changes.
